## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

* What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?
  * Role Based Acess Control (RBAC) is a security model that provides a structured and efficient approach to managing access rights within an application or system. 
  * **It is a method of controlling access to resources based on the roles assigned to individual users or groups.**

* Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.
  * Admin
    * create, read, update, delete
  * Editor 
    * read, create, update
  * User 
    * read, create
  * Guest 
    * read

* What are the Benefits of RBAC?
  * Employees are only allowed to access the information necessary to effectively perform their job duties. 
  * Access can be based on several factors, such as authority, responsibility, and job competency. 
  * In addition, access to computer resources can be limited to specific tasks such as the ability to view, create, or modify a file.
  * Using RBAC will help in securing your companyâ€™s sensitive data and important applications.
