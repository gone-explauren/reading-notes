1. An object in JS, like an object in the real world has features or properties that make it unique, like size and shape and color, etc.

2. it gives you shorthand for the object which is more convenient

3. (I didn't fully understand this on but..) Arrays can store multiple items in a single variable and objects are... different in a way that I don't understand well enough to put into my own words lol..

4. use bracket notation when property identifiers are a string or a var that is a string

5. "this" refers to the "age" in that object specifically, as there is only one and that is "this"




1. DOM = Document Object Model. Allows programs to change doc structure, style, content, etc.

2. JavaScript allows us to interact with the DOM
