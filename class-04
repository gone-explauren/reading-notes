1. <a></a> element creates a link

2. href specifies the URL the link goes to

3. links can be made accessible by describing your link clearly, not using the URL for the link text

1. normal flow: the way block and inline elements are shown on the page before changing the layout

2. block: starts on a new line, takes up all the space available. inline: flows around other content, takes up as much space as it needs

3. static

4. an element can be placed exactly where you want it, relative to the next parent element with an absolute position

5. absolute: all the above, plus it is removed from the flow of the page, and is unaffected by other elements and vice versa. fixed: positioned relative to the browser itself, will stay where it is when the page scrolls

1. declaration: declares creation of all functions and variables in JS. invocation: executes code

2. parameter: the name listed in the definition of the function. argument: values passed to the function

1. Pair programming is valuable bc when you work together as a team, the programmers can help each other solve problems and give a fresh pair of eyes to code when you can't figure out why it's not working. Also, you can split the work and make the workload easier, as well as work to the strengths of each programmer. Today in lab, it was great to have Phil next to me to help me out when I got stuck. Pair programming can be a life-saver :)
