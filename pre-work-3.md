# ES6 Classes

## Objects and Inheritance
* JavaScript objects use prototype-based inheritance.
* It can be loosely described by saying that when methods or properties are attached to objectâ€™s prototype they become available for use on that object and its descendants, but not directly attached to them.
* Prototype Inheritence:

function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Animal.prototype.walk = function() {}

function Bird(name) {
  // I can do all the things animals can do!
  Animal.call(this, name);
}
// Unlike other animals, birds can fly
Bird.prototype.fly = function() {}

// Make a new bird ..
let parrot = new Bird('parrot');
parrot.fly();
parrot.walk();

## Classes
* Classes are standalone, self-contained object (instance) factories. Ultimately, they result in a prototype, but are easier to comprehend and work with.
* **function()** becomes **class {}**
* **call()** becomes **extends**

class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name  = name;
  }

  walk() {}
}

// Thanks to 'extends', all birds can now do all things animals can
class Bird extends Animal {
  // Birds can walk, becuase they're animals also do their own thing.
  fly() {}
}

// Make one (the same was as before, but wasn't the class creation much easier?)
let parrot = new Bird('parrot');
parrot.fly();
parrot.walk();
