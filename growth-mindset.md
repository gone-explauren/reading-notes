# Deliberate Practice
* *"Upgrade your technical skills with ***deliberate practice***"*
* You don't better your skills bystaying in your comfort zone
  * "In this market, you will be rewarded handsomely for building one boring CRUD application after another. To upgrade your hard technical skills however, you'll need to apply deliberate practice."
  * *Deliberate practice* involves challenging yourself and excercising critital thinking a problem solving skills.
* Most learning, naturally, happens early in your career (or in school)
  * As your skills imporve and you fit the mold expected of you by the industry, opportunities to learn and grow are provided less and less by your dayjob
  * Deliberate practice to improve your technical skills beyond the baseline of what it required of you will be a valable weapon against complacency.
  
* Deliberate practice can be summarized as:
  * *"Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual’s performance."*
  * It *pushes you just outside your comfort zone*
  * It should be *repeated often*
  * Feedback on results is continuously available
  * It's highly demanding mentally
  * It's difficult
  * It requires **good goals**
  
* ***"We're all self-taught in this business. The only person who understands your skillset well enough to teach you is you. What challenges can you set yourself that meet these criteria?"***

## Self-Assessment Scores
* Self-Awareness: **18/25**
  * I feel as though this score is accurate
  * I have a pretty good understanding of myself and my emotions
  * Recently, I have been second-guessing my gut reations and intution about certain situations
  * I think this is why this score is slightly lower after today's self-assessment than it has been for in previous self-assessments

* Self-Management: **16/25**
  * This was my lowest score of the four in this self-assessment.
  * I believe this is because I rated myself very low in impulse control.
  * I tend to make quick judgements based on whatever I'm feeling at the time and I don't take the time to think things through
    * That is, unless it's a heafty financial decision...
    * though I know this is much more because I've spent all my money being too damn impulsive all my adult life long...
    * and much less about having actually learned my lesson and practicing better impulse control :) :( :) :(
  * To take credit where credit is due, however, I am very good at containing my negative emotions (anger, mostly) and not taking them out on others
    * I feel very able to handle myself with composure and treat all people with their deserved kindness and respect regardless of my inner feels
    * I regret any moment I am mean to someone (unless they really deserved it tbh), so I am very slow to react on a gut decision after someone does something that triggers me
  
* Social Awareness: **23/25**
  * My highest score in this self-asssment
  * This one surprised me.. I feel as though it's not inaccurate, per se, but I didn't expect it to be my "best" score
  * I do not doubt my ability to idetify social cues, but I sometimes choose to blatantly disregard them
    * usually just for the lolz or whatever
    * not to actively make people uncomforable or anything

* Relationship Mamagement: **21/25**
* I know I generally have ability to be pretty good in this area
* I understand the importance of being able to empathize and communicate well with my coworkers and colleagues and I think I do this well
* I'm very good at getting along with all (or at least most) people, regardless of what differences we may have

# Assessing Bias
* We all have implicit biases. 
* It’s helpful to identify those biases that can affect how you work with other people.
* <https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/301/bias-assessment.pdf>

## Self-Assessment Scores
* There were a lot of sections for this, so I'm just going to talk about what I saw to be the most important areas :)

* Bias and Identity: **13/15**
  * I recognize my own internal biasies and do my best to re-learn these through practicing empathy and educating myself on things I don't understand
  * I know that more diverse work groups lead to better overall products, because diversity in experice can foster exciting new ideas, solutions, and collaborations

* Bias and the Brain: **9/15**
  * I recognize that everyone has implicit biases and that doesn't make you a bad person
  * Like how they say "We are not responsible for our first thought, but we are responsible for our second thought and our first action."
    * I don't know who the "they" is who says this, but I've heard this so many times...
    * It's like, the gut reaction that is either innate or was taught to you from a young age
    * It's not always rational or logical or right
    * Your "second thought" is more grounded, based in experiences and education, more thought-out
  * I scored poorly in this section because of the impulsivity thing again.
     * I don't think I would say I act impulsively in the area of like, judging people? 
     * But the questions about this in the self-assessment didn't specify, and I was just honest when I said that I usually act impulsively when making decisions
     * Again, though, not generally when making decisions about others or that will impact others in a mean9iingful way

* Empathy and Curiousity: **11/15** and Meaningful Connections: **11/15**
  * I'm grouping these two together because things I want to say about them are interchangeable
  * I recognize that I am very much one to stay in my own lane, idealogically speaking.
    * I do leave my lane sometimes when someone needs to be run off the road
    * metaphorically speaking, of course
  * I tend not to have conversations about socio-politcal ideaolgies that flat-out oppose my own
    * I feel like discussing these topics with people completely opposing views to my own don't lead very far
    * I have already cultivated the foundation of my opinions and to attempt to completely dismantle that would be impractical
    * And this is the same for people with views that oppose mine - We are viewing the world in fundamentlly opposing ways.
  * Where I do think there is room for debate and where I do think debate should be encouraged, however, is in the more nuanced areas of our own viewpoints.
    * I've heard the echo chamber analogy many, many times, and I understand how easy it is to surround yourself with viewpoints that only match your own exactly
    * I think it's important to be able to weed through the opinions and find the facts, then base your own opinions off of those
    * Someone with similar ideological views on the world would be much more likely to sway my opinion on one small facet of my own personal ideology than someone with radically different views to my own
  * I guess what I'm describing is opinions that change gradually over time based on facts rather than opinions
    * yeah, that.
    * :)
