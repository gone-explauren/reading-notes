1. if the image can't be displayed on the browser you could you an alt attribute.
2. the alt tag can also add with accessibility in the case that a user uses a screen reader
3.figure is self-contained and can be moved away from the main flow of the document
4. dimensions of a gif are fixed and the gif will pixilate if you zoom in or change the dimensions, but this doesn't happen with a svg.
5. PNG is best because there won't be much color data

1. foreground color would be the text and objects on a page and background is the blank space behind the stuff on the page.
2. this is a hard one because my website currently has noooo color haha, but I would use style background-color and then maybe change some of the text headers
3. consider readability on all/most browsers and screen sizes, and most of the time you want it to be professional as well.
4. changes the style of the text. font size makes it larger or smaller, weight changes how bold or light the text is, and style is the font used and what it looks like
5. you could add padding to the h1 element or you could add a border
