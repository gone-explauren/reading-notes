### Clients and Servers
Clients are devices connected to the internet or software that accesses the web.  
Servers store webpages, apps, etc.  
TCP/IP define how data should travel thru the web 
DNS "address book" for websites 
HTTP is the language clients and servers use to talk to each other  
HTML is read first, then CSS, then scripts (JavaScript)   

### JavaScript Basics
JavaSript makes websites interactive (games, animation, etc)    
<script> element is used for writing JavaScript 
JavaScripts placed near the bottom of an HTML page because HTML should load first, 
and the browser reads the code in the order it appears in the file.   
**Variables** store values (ie. let)  
**Operators** are mathmetical symbols that produce results based on two variables   
**Conditionals** are used to test if an expression returns true or not.   
**Functions** allow you to reuse code defined as a function (??)
   
### HTML
Tells the web browser how to structure the pages you visit  
Needs an opening tag amd a closing tag  
*Nesting elements* are elements placed inside other elements    
Attributes wont appear in the conent, it is extra info for the browser     
Boolean attributes are written without values
