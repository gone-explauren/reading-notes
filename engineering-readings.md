# Pretend Your Time is Worth $1000/hr
* <https://anthony-moore.medium.com/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-6ab2302b8e8c>

## This Article Sucks
* This one annoyed me from the start because I strongly disagree with the explicit premise that humans are meant to be productive and efficient and that is the best / only valid way to live your life
* "You have very few hours here on on this earth. Still, many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission."
  * Fuck you, my mission is to enjoy my life and I get to decide what that means.
  * I love wasting time. If I have time, I enjoy wasting it. I like my lil naps and my lil walks to people watch and I like taking my time to do my own shitin my own free time.
* The guy who wrote this bullshit embodies grind culture and I think he sucks.
  * As I type out my thoughts, I find myself thinking "I'm being really harsh on this guy, I should give him a chance to share his opinion"
  * But then I go back and read more and I realize nah, there's really no misinterpreting this. This guy just sucks majorly and his opinion sucks too.
  * If this is the way you wanna live your life, by all means, go ahead. However, I think people like this are generally pretty boring, elitist, and their priorities are all fucked up. ~In my opinion.~
* I'll conceed that good time management is good! of course! it's a skill I want to imprve and I think it's good if everyone tried to improve it too!
  * But every single piece of advice in this goddamned article is dripping with contempt for people wh aren't "successful" and wrapped in the most pretentious, better-than-you, uber capitalistic elite tone I could possible imagine.

## The Onion could just copy/paste this entire article and pass it off as their own parody of grind-culture alpha men like this
* but like, this guy is being... serious?
* "They say yes to things they have no business doing. They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take."
  * Fuck you
* "They spend hours watching low-quality television and social media when they should be productive and effective."
  * Mind your own business? Who gave you the right to tell others what they "should" be doing?
* "See, many people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well), but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy, and stuck."
  * Fuck youuuuu, you judgemental fuckhead.
* This is the single most infuriating and least inspiriational bullshit I have ever fucking been assigned to read in my entire life are you literally kidding me.

## One Thing I Agree With!
* Spoiler alert! It wasn't something this shitty fuckhead author wrote at all!
* Later in the article, the author provides a quote:
  * "Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day."
    * I do agree with this quote, fully. I do not believe the author believes this quote. 
    * It is clear from the trainwreck of an introduction that this author thinks that anytime spent not being robotically productive is a waste of time.
    * And he can fuck off.
    
# The Super Mario Effect
* *tricking your brain into learning more*
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0&ab_channel=TEDxTalks>
* This guy is a lot more likable, so this section will be shorter as I have less to complain about :)

## "That Sucked, What Did We Learn from That?"
* Each failure teaches you something
* If we try again with this new knowledge, will the outcome be different?
  * (*the answer is usually yes*)
  
## Life Gamification
* Learn to view challenges for what they are, challenges, as opposed to stopping points
  * Repeat a "level" if you need to, in both Super Mario Bros and IRL
* If you can trick your mind into having *fun* with a challenge, you will actually *want* to keep trying at it
  * **Reframe***
  * *Test* becomes *Game*
  * Make challenges fun 
* It's not just "Hang in there :)" and telling yourself to have a positive attitude
  * "Those sort of imply that you're having to endure a your true desire to quit"

# 5 Whys
* <https://www.mindtools.com/a3mi00v/5-whys>

## Stubborn or recurrent problems are often symptoms of deeper issues
* Drill down to the root cause  of a problem by asking "Why?" five times.
* 5Y works best with simple, recurrent problems rather than more complex troubleshooting
  * 5Y can lead you to pursue a single track of inquiry when troubleshooting
  * In reality, there could be multiple causes for the problem

## How to Use the 5 Whys
* Assemble a team
  * include a facillitator
* Define the Problem
  * see it in action
* Ask your first Why
* Ask four more Whys
  * drill down and find out the answers each time
  * Try to move quickly from one question to the next, so that you have the full picture before you jump to any conclusions.
* Know when to stop
* Find the root cause(s)

# How to Think Like a Programmer
* Become a more efficient problem-solver
* <https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2>    
    
## Have a Framework
* Understand
  * Know exactly what is being asked
  * Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them
* Plan your solution
  * “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
* Divide the problem
  * "Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry."
  * I like this quote a lot. I will use this.
  * Break the problem into smaller sub-problems and solve those
* It's okay to get stuck
  * debug and reassess
  * maybe take a break
  * come back more *curious* about the problem and less irritated by it

# How to Solve Programming Problems
* <https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/>

## Common Mistakes
* Coding first, thinking on the fly
* Overthinking and attempting to over-solve the problem

## Simple Problem-Solving Steps
* Read the problem twice
* Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
  * sounds v specific but okay
  * "manually" as in, no code
* Optimize the manual solution
  * figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier
  * see if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify
* Write psuedo-code or comments
* Replace comments with code
* Optimize the code

### Discussion Questions
1) What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
    * A fresh and unique perspective for brainstorming ideas and problem-solving
2) What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
    * Break it down and look at the problem step-by-step
    * Walk away if I find myself getting irritated
    * Write psuedocode and solve problems manually to fully understand the solution
