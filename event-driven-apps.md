# Event-Driven Programming

* What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
EventEmitter

* What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
  * Instead of one object triggering a function inside of another object, an object can **emit** events
  * Any objects listening for those events will then process the event as it was programmed to do

* Explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
Instead of objects needing to "talk" to each other and sending messages back and forth via routes like a game of telephone, EDP allows objects to communicate directly
EDP allows for real time communication, as functions are triggered the moment an event happens
