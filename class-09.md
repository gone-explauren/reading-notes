### Functional Programming Concepts

## What is functional programming?
* *A programming paradigm* - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs. 
* This treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.
  
## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
* A function that returns the same output that was given as an input
* (returns the same result if given the same arguments)
  
## What are the benefits of a pure function?
* Pure functions make the code easier to test

## What is immutability?
* State is unchangeable after creation

## What is Referential transparency?
* When a pure function is passed with immutable data
