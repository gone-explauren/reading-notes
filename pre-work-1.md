# Diving into React


## What is React?
React is an *agnostic user interface library*. It is used to create interfaces (charts, search feilds, widgets, or entire applications).

## What is a component?
A component is small piece of code that fills a certain part of the user interface that you're building with React.

## What is the dataflow of React?
React has a one-way dataflow.

## How do we make a React element a DOM element?
Through a component state

## React is a User Interface ______.
Library

## Which direction does data flow in React?
Data flows down from the app down from parent component/elements to their children and grandchildren component/elements.
**State** ***exists at a*** **component level** ***and is*** **passed down.**

## Every component manages its own ____.
*I don't really know what answer they're looking for here but* Each component with one or more chold component can control which child elements get the data, and children elements are not permitted to talk back to their parent element. Very metaphoic.


### What I'd like to know more about
* I learned that ReactDOM works with the browser, but I don't understand fully what ReactDOM actually is? Will we learn more about this in class?
* ***React Element is not a DOM Element.*** I don't understand what this means.
