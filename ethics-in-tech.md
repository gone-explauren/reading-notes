# Project Dragonfly: Google's censored search engine.

This article discussed Google creating a censored search engine for use in China, where the authoritarian government has many restrictions regarding what their users can and cannot see online.
Personally, I strongly agree with the backlash this project recieved. 
I think that conforming to an unreasonable authoritarian government's oppressive stipulations in order to continue doing busniess with them soley for profit is actively harming the people who live there.
This project is a blatant money grab and an abuse of power on Google's part, and it directly goes against the Company's stated policy.
With all the good that Google has brought to the modern world, it also holds the power to do great evil, and time will tell if morals and ethics can trump corporate greed.

# Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?

Honestly, this is an artile I didn't want to read because the real-world implications of this kind of thing actually scare me quite a bit...
As in article I read prior to this one, we are confronted with the idea that technology itself is neither good nor evil, but rather is pushed one way or the other by those at the top who control it.
The full power of AI in the hands of a country like China would be a dreadful thing to happen to humanity, particularly for those who live in China.
I don't think that this is alarmism; we've dealing with the effects of tech in the wrong hands for as long as tech has been a thing.
However, it is definitely scarier now than it ever has been before with the rapid advancement of AI and the possibility for all the negative ramefications that come along with it.
